# Knet

Knet is a machine learning module implemented in
[Julia](http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/release-0.4), so you should be
able to run it on any machine that can run Julia.  It has been tested
on Julia 0.4.2 using Linux machines with NVIDIA GPUs and CUDA
libraries, but most of it works on vanilla Linux and OSX machines as
well (currently cpu-only support for some operations is incomplete).
Knet is an open-source project and we are always open to new
contributions: bug reports and fixes, feature requests and
contributions, new machine learning models and operators, inspiring
examples, benchmarking results are all welcome.

* If you would like to try Knet on your own computer, please follow
the [installation
instructions](https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl/blob/master/docs/install.rst#installation).
* If you would like to try working with a GPU and do not have access
to one, take a look at the [Using Amazon
AWS](https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl/blob/master/docs/install.rst#using-amazon-aws)
section.
* If you need help please consider joining the
[knet-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/knet-users)
mailing list.
* If you find a bug, or would like to request a feature,
please open a [GitHub
issue](https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl/issues).
