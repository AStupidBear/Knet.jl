Knet (pronounced "Kay-Net") is a machine learning package implemented in
[Julia](http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/latest), so you should be able
to run it on any machine that can run Julia.  It has been tested on
Julia 0.4 and later using Linux machines with NVIDIA GPUs and the CUDA
library, but most of it works on vanilla Linux and OSX machines as
well (currently cpu-only support for some operations is incomplete).
Knet is an open-source project and we are always open to new
contributions: bug reports and fixes, feature requests and
contributions, new machine learning models and operators, inspiring
examples, benchmarking results are all welcome.

* If you would like a quick introduction to Knet, try the [tutorial](http://knet.readthedocs.org/en/latest/intro.html).
* If you would like to try Knet on your own computer, please follow the [installation instructions](http://knet.readthedocs.org/en/dev/install.html#installation).
* If you would like to try working with a GPU and do not have access to one, take a look at the [using Amazon AWS](http://knet.readthedocs.org/en/dev/install.html#using-amazon-aws) tutorial.
* If you need help or would like to request a feature, please consider joining the [knet-users](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/knet-users) mailing list.
* If you find a bug, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/denizyuret/Knet.jl/issues).
