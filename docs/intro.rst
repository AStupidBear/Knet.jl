A Tutorial Introduction
***********************

TODO:
- we need to talk about installation somewhere.
- Other requirements like v0.4.0, cuda libraries, cpu compatibility etc.
- + Install latest v0.4.2.
- + Update packages.
- + Figure out no-gpu installation (CUDA* requirements)
- Create an amazon aws image for easy gpu work.

We will begin by a quick tutorial on Knet.

- linear regression?  uci?  https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing
- or do we do artificial data generation: cpu/gpu conversion may be difficult.
- mnist definitely
- mnist4d for convolution
- maybe something else for simple nnet?
- copyseq to introduce rnns
