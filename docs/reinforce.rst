  For more about REINFORCE and more generally Reinforcement Learning
  and policy gradient methods (which REINFORCE is a special case of)
  David Silver's class, or one of Pieter Abbeel's classes.
  This is very much ongoing work but these hard attention models have
  been explored, for example, in Inferring Algorithmic Patterns with
  Stack-Augmented Recurrent Nets, Reinforcement Learning Neural
  Turing Machines, and Show Attend and Tell.
